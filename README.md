# Real Coded Genetic Algorithm in Python!
rcgapy is a python implemented real coded genetic algorithm [1] to find good local optima
for any linear or nonlinear functions with linear, nonlinear and integer constraints. 

## Environment setup
rcgapy simply depends on numpy and numba for numerical computations and 
matplotlib for visualization.
Just run the following command to get started.

```[python]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example
Here is an example how to minimize a nonlinear objective function subject to linear, nonlinear
and integer constraints.
